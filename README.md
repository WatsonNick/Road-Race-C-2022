# Road Race C++

**Road Race** is a simple terminal-based car racing game developed in C++. This project was created to implement fundamental programming concepts in a fun and interactive way. The objective is to steer a car, avoid oncoming traffic, and achieve the highest possible score.

## üìú Description

In this game, the player controls a car represented by `ASCII` characters. The objective is to navigate left and right, dodging enemy cars approaching from the top of the screen. The score increases the longer the player successfully avoids a collision. After the game ends, players can enter their name to save their score on the local leaderboard.

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Simple Gameplay:** Easy-to-learn controls using just the 'A' and 'D' keys.
  * **Terminal Graphics:** Utilizes `ASCII` art to create a retro, console-based game environment.
